Maven was utilized as a build automation tool to manage project dependencies, build processes, and project documentation. It streamlined the development and execution of automation tests in our project.

# TestNG
TestNG framework was employed for its rich feature set, including support for parameterized tests, test prioritization, and flexible test configuration. It facilitated the creation and execution of comprehensive test suites for our automation testing efforts.

# Test Cases
We meticulously designed and implemented test cases covering various aspects of the Apple Store website, including product search, navigation, user authentication, and checkout process. These test cases were structured to validate both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

# Execution
The automation tests were executed using the chosen tools and frameworks within the development environment. Continuous integration practices were employed to automate test execution and provide timely feedback on the application's behavior.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, our automation testing efforts on the Apple Store website using Java, Maven, and TestNG have contributed to the overall quality and reliability of the software. By automating repetitive test scenarios, we improved efficiency, reduced manual effort, and ensured consistent test results. We remain committed to leveraging automation testing to enhance the user experience and maintain the integrity of the Apple Store website.
